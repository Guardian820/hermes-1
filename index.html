        <h3><a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>
        <p>Hermes is an open-source distributed unlimited redundant backup solution.</p>
        <p>With current backup storage systems, it is all too common to have a high investment, while getting a tiny amount storage, that often come along with privacy issues. Hermes aims to offers a free and open-source network of computers all around the world to provide a distributed and most importantly, anonymous backup solution. The system uses LZMA compression to provide a large amount of network redundancy without having dedicated servers. Files pushed to the network are also encrypted with AES, and split up into blocks to be sent all around the world.</p>

        <h3><a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>To start using Hermes, you must first download and install the client to your computer. Next you must generate and load a vault key to authenticate your client, and allow you to connect to the network. You can do it it like this:</p>
        <pre><code>$ hermes generate key_file<br />$ hermes load key_file<br />$ hermes update</code></pre>
        <p>Your computer will sync with the Hermes network, allowing you to push and pull files to and from your vault. Make sure to backup your keyfile as this is the only way to gain access to your vault.</p>

        <!-- <h3><a name="Developers" class="anchor" href="#developers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are you a developer?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p> -->
